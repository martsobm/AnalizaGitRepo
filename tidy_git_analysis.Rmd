[\@drsimonj](https://twitter.com/drsimonj) here to help you embark on git repo analyses!

Ever wondered who contributes to git repos? How their contributions have changed over time? What sort of conventions different authors use in their commit messages? Maybe you were inspired by [Mara Averick](https://twitter.com/dataandme) to [contribute to tidyverse packages](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/contributing-to-tidyverse-packages/) and wonder how you fit in?

This post -- intended for intermediate R users -- will help you answer these sorts of questions using tidy R tools.

Install and load these packages to follow along:

```{r init-example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Parts 1 and 2
library(tidyverse)
library(glue)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)

# Part 3
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
library(tidytext)
```

# Part 1: Git repo to a tidy data frame

## Get a git repo

We'll explore the open-source [ggplot2 repo](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) by copying it to our local machine with [`git clone`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone), typically run on a command-line like:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git clone <repository_url> <directory>
```

Find the `<repository_url>` for [github.com](https://github.com/) projects by clicking "Clone or download".

<img src="../ggplot2_gitclone.png">

`<directory>` is optional but useful for us to clone into a specific location.

The R code below clones the ggplot2 git repo into a temporary directory called `"git_repo"` (let [Alexander Matrunich](https://twitter.com/matrunich) teach you more about temp directories and files [here](http://rstat.consulting/blog/temporary-dir-and-files-in-r/?utm_content=buffer0d542&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)). `system()` invokes these commands from R (instead of using a command-line directly) and the [glue package](http://glue.tidyverse.org/) beautifully handles the strings for us.

```{r, warning = TRUE}
# Remote repository URL
repo_url <- "https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2.git"

# Directory into which git repo will be cloned
clone_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "git_repo")

# Create command
clone_cmd <- glue("git clone {repo_url} {clone_dir}")

# Invoke command
system(clone_cmd)
```

Check the directory contents:

```{r}
list.files(clone_dir)
```

## Get tidy git history

You can now access the git history of the local repo using [`git log`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) (making sure to target the right directory with `-C`). Examine the last few commits via:

```{r, eval = F}
system(glue('git -C {clone_dir} log -3'))
```
```{r, echo = F}
cat(system(glue('git -C {clone_dir} log -3'), intern = TRUE), sep = '\n')
```

This default output is nice but difficult to parse. Fortunately, `git log` has the `--pretty` option, which the code below uses to create a command to return nicely formatted logs (learn more about log formatting [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History)):

```{r}
log_format_options <- c(datetime = "cd", commit = "h", parents = "p", author = "an", subject = "s")
option_delim <- "\t"
log_format   <- glue("%{log_format_options}") %>% collapse(option_delim)
log_options  <- glue('--pretty=format:"{log_format}" --date=format:"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"')
log_cmd      <- glue('git -C {clone_dir} log {log_options}')
log_cmd
```

This outputs each commit as a string of tab-separated values:

```{r, eval = F}
system(glue('{log_cmd} -3'))
```
```{r, echo = F}
cat(system(glue('{log_cmd} -3'), intern = TRUE), sep = '\n')
```

The R code below executes this for the entire repo, captures the output (via `intern = TRUE`), splits commit strings into vectors of values (thanks to [stringr](http://stringr.tidyverse.org/)), and converts them to a named [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/).

```{r}
history_logs <- system(log_cmd, intern = TRUE) %>% 
  str_split_fixed(option_delim, length(log_format_options)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  setNames(names(log_format_options))

history_logs
```

The entire git commit history is now a tidy data frame (tibble)! We'll finish this section with two minor additions.

First, the `parents` column can contain space-separated strings when a commit was a merge of multiple, for example. The code below converts this to a list-column of character vectors (let [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) teach you more about this [here](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/using-list-cols-in-your-dataframe/)):

```{r}
history_logs <- history_logs %>% 
  mutate(parents = str_split(parents, " "))

history_logs
```

Finally, be sure to assign branch numbers to commits. There's surely a better way to do this, but here's one (very untidy) method:

```{r}
# Start with NA
history_logs <- history_logs %>% mutate(branch = NA_integer_)

# Create a boolean vector to represent free columns (1000 should be plenty!)
free_col <- rep(TRUE, 1000)

for (i in seq_len(nrow(history_logs) - 1)) { # - 1 to ignore root
  # Check current branch col and assign open col if NA
  branch <- history_logs$branch[i]
  
  if (is.na(branch)) {
    branch <- which.max(free_col)
    free_col[branch] <- FALSE
    history_logs$branch[i] <- branch
  }
  
  # Go through parents
  parents <- history_logs$parents[[i]]
  
  for (p in parents) {
    parent_col <- history_logs$branch[history_logs$commit == p]
    
    # If col is missing, assign it to same branch (if first parent) or new
    # branch (if other)
    if (is.na(parent_col)) {
      parent_col <- if_else(p == parents[1], branch, which.max(free_col))
      
    # If NOT missing this means a split has occurred. Assign parent the lowest
    # and re-open both cols (parent closed at the end)
    } else {
      free_col[c(branch, parent_col)] <- TRUE
      parent_col <- min(branch, parent_col)
      
    }
    
    # Close parent col and assign
    free_col[parent_col] <- FALSE
    history_logs$branch[history_logs$commit == p] <- parent_col
  }
}
```

We now also have branch values with `1` being the root.

```{r}
history_logs
```

This rounds off the section on getting a git commit history into a tidy data frame. Remove the local git repo, which is no longer needed:

```{r}
unlink(clone_dir, recursive = TRUE)
```

# Part 2: Tidy Analysis

You're now ready to embark on a tidy git repo analysis! For example, which authors make the most commits?

```{r}
history_logs %>% 
  count(author, sort = TRUE)
```

Some authors appear under different names, which we can quickly correct based on these top cases:

```{r}
history_logs <- history_logs %>% 
  mutate(author = case_when(
    str_detect(tolower(author), "hadley") ~ "Hadley Wickham",
    str_detect(tolower(author), "kohske takahashi") ~ "Kohske Takahashi",
    TRUE ~ str_to_title(author)
  ))
```

Now, again, authors by commit frequency:

```{r}
history_logs %>% 
  count(author) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

And top-ten visualized with [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/):

```{r}
history_logs %>% 
  count(author) %>% 
  top_n(10, n) %>% 
  mutate(author = fct_reorder(author, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(author, n)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = n), show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    ggtitle("ggplot2 authors with most commits") +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Number of commits", caption = "Post by @drsimonj")
```

Not surprising to see [Hadley Wikham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham) topping the charts. Otherwise, the analysis options are pretty endless from here!

# Part 3: Advanced Topics

I'd like to touch on two advanced topics before leaving you to embark on astounding git repo analyses.

## Git repo as a relational graph

A git history is a relational structure where commits are nodes and connections between them are directed edges (from parent to child).

The code below converts our tidy data frame into a tidy relational structure made up of two data frames (nodes and edges) thanks to [tidygraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) (learn more from the package creator, [Thomas Lin Pedersen](https://twitter.com/thomasp85), in [blog posts like this](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/)).

```{r}
# Convert commit to a factor (for ordering nodes)
history_logs <- history_logs %>% 
  mutate(commit = factor(commit))

# Nodes are the commits (keeping relevant info)
nodes <- history_logs %>% 
  select(-parents) %>% 
  arrange(commit)

# Edges are connections between commits and their parents
edges <- history_logs %>% 
  select(commit, parents) %>% 
  unnest(parents) %>% 
  mutate(parents = factor(parents, levels = levels(commit))) %>% 
  transmute(from = as.integer(parents), to = as.integer(commit)) %>% 
  drop_na()

# Create tidy directed graph object
git_graph <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = TRUE)
```
```{r}
git_graph
```

Using [ggraph](https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph) (another of Thomas' awesome packages with more detailed info in [posts like this](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/ggraph-introduction-layouts/)) a default visualization could look something like this:

```{r}
git_graph %>% 
  ggraph() +
    geom_edge_link(alpha = .1) +
    geom_node_point(aes(color = factor(branch)), alpha = .3) +
    theme_graph() +
    theme(legend.position = "none")
```

This looks cool but not right! A `"manual"` layout is needed for a linear visualisation of the git history (see the [dplyr network](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/network) for example).

For convenience, this is a template pipeline that will take the tidy graph object, ensure the proper layout is used, and create the basic plot:

```{r}
ggraph_git <- . %>%
  # Set node x,y coordinates
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(x = datetime, y = branch) %>% 
  # Plot with correct layout
  create_layout(layout = "manual", node.positions = as_tibble(activate(., nodes))) %>% 
  {ggraph(., layout = "manual") + theme_graph() + labs(caption = "Post by @drsimonj")}
```

Using this pipeline:

```{r}
git_graph %>% 
  ggraph_git() +
    geom_edge_link(alpha = .1) +
    geom_node_point(aes(color = factor(branch)), alpha = .3) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    ggtitle("Commit history of ggplot2")
```

Much better! You can go crazy with how you'd like to visualise the repo. For example, here we filter on a specific date range:

```{r}
git_graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  filter(datetime > "2015-11-01", datetime < "2016-08-01") %>% 
  ggraph_git() +
    geom_edge_link(alpha = .1) +
    geom_node_point(aes(color = factor(branch)), alpha = .3) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    ggtitle("Git history of ggplot2",
            subtitle = "2015-11 to 2016-08")
```

Here commits are highlighted for the top authors:

```{r}
# 10 most-common authors
top_authors <- git_graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  count(author, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(10, n) %>% 
  pull(author)

# Plot
git_graph %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>%
  filter(datetime > "2015-11-01", datetime < "2016-08-01") %>% 
  mutate(author = factor(author, levels = top_authors),
         author = fct_explicit_na(author, na_level = "Other")) %>% 
  ggraph_git() +
    geom_edge_link(alpha = .1) +
    geom_node_point(aes(color = author), alpha = .3) +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
    ggtitle("ggplot2 commits by author",
            subtitle = "2015-11 to 2016-08")
```

I hope this gives you enough to start having fun with these sorts of visualisations!

## Text Mining Commit Messages

Commit messages are simple but great material for tidy text-mining tools like the brilliant [tidytext package](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext), best learned from [Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach](https://www.tidytextmining.com/), by [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob). Here are some examples using commit subjects to get you started.

Get commit subjects into a tidy format and remove stop words.

```{r}
data(stop_words)

tidy_subjects <- history_logs %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, subject) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_subjects
```

What are the ten most frequently used words?

```{r}
tidy_subjects %>%
  count(word) %>% 
  top_n(10, n) %>% 
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
    geom_col(aes(fill = n), show.legend = FALSE) +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal() +
    ggtitle("Most-used words in ggplot2 commit subjects") +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Word frequency", caption = "Post by @drsimonj")
```

Or how about the words that most-frequently follow "fix", the most-used word:

```{r}
history_logs %>% 
  select(commit, author, subject) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram, subject, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>% 
  separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>% 
  filter(word1 == "fix") %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("word2" = "word")) %>% 
  count(word2, sort = TRUE)
```

Unsurprisingly, it seems like many of the commits involve fixing bugs and typos, as well as challenges with geoms and guides.

We've now covered more than enough for you to explore and analyse git repos in a tidy R framework. Don't forget to share your findings with the world and let me know about it!
